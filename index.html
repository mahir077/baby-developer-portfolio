            <p>I love to read books. Its my only habit which I am continuing since my childhood. I have read different
                kinds
                of books but I prefer mostly the detective genre. Besides that I love to ride bike. Till now
                I
                have went to few districts of Bangladesh with my bike. But currently I am learning Web Development and I
                am very serious about it. Because I want to be a best Web Developer.</p>
